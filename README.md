# Wrirtng Sample : Wrote this piece as an assignment for a course at San Jose State University. The course outlined the importance of good writing skills in a technical environment, writing technical pieces for non-technical audience and presenting project's implementation plan or POC before the actual product is delivered.

Here is the article for which the piece was written. The paper presents the idea of Smart Objects and how are they the building block of Internet of Things. I have written the idea of building a smart vitals monitoring system. This was intended for general audience to understand concept of smart objects and a healthcare facility owner who will be using this device on campus.
